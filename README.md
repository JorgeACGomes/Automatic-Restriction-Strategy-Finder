Update History:

Restriction_Finder added to repository

It's a super preliminary approach, just to get around with the way the packages from pydna and biopython work.
Got some compatibility issues with the sequence representation, namely the Dseq format, not being able to use the  enzymes' catalyze method from Bio.Restriction package
It should be pushed sooner, however I wasn't yet to capable with git
